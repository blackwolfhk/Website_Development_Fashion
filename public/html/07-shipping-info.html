                To ensure the product condition of your order, we will examine the products again before we send out the
                package. Recently our system detected some scam orders, and it causes a manual check for order
                situation,
                which would take less than <b>5 business days</b> to check your order items. After the order check, your
                package will be sent and you should be able to check your package information by Order Track. Please
                contact
                us if you need to assist due to any urgent situation.
