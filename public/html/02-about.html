          <h2>OUR STROY</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Welcome to Free Style, your top pick of techwear and streetwear
            style clothing. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of
            techwear and streetwear, with a focus on techwear style, cyberpunk
            style, urban utility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded by a group of passionate young techwear lovers, Free Style
            has come a long way from its beginnings. When we first started
            out, our passion for “making more affordable techwear clothing”
            drove us to study and research the best techwear in the market,
            then working on making our own techwear. so that Free Style can
            offer you the most aggressive value of techwear style clothing. We
            now serve customers all over the world and are thrilled that we're
            able to turn our passion into our own website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We founded the brand Free Style in 2020, the year COVID-19
            started. When we were forced to stay at home, we got a lot of time
            to think about things other than business work. We generated a
            group of techwear lovers, talking about what is our ideal
            techwear, an idea popped up: Why don't we build our own techwear?
            Then we pushed this idea came true, we did have a techwear brand
            right now.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            We called ourselves Free Style because we hope customers and us
            could be in a more friendly atmosphere like a club or pub. And we
            don't have physical stores because we still got our own jobs to
            do. But thanks to that, we don't need to pay for the rent for
            stores, giving us the opportunity to keep the price in a really
            decent price range. Price shouldn't be the barrier stopping you or
            anybody from having a good value techwear style clothing. That is
            Free Style's mission statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the development of about a year, we do find out that
            streetwear is pretty close to techwear in some way. Streetwear is
            a strong way to express your own appeal of your understanding and
            lifestyle, especially in cloth painting and design. Comparing with
            techwear, streetwear is more passionate and energetic for young
            generations. Techwear clothing uses low-key fabrics in
            black/white/grey to protect users in urban living, while
            streetwear is using draft painting to go against the world. Two
            contrasting groups of users surprisingly share similar
            characteristics. That could be the reason why we are starting to
            have streetwear collections in Free Style.
